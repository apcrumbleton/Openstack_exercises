After you get registered to login to citycloud and can see the parts of the interface....

You should CREATE A USER
Even though you have a user (an admin) that can login to the site, this is NOT the user that OS will use for operations on the API!!

via API->Native Openstack API "Create user" button:
make a new user with a password, and drag accross the default project so that they can use it.
NOTE: "API user created successfully" message should be received when the user is added and given access to the project

NOW, with the user created, they appear in the "Native Openstack API" page under "Users"
AND, there is a "cog" wheel button to the right of the user, this button has the option to "Download RC-File", which is what is mentioned in the OpenStack and Shade documents

With that file downloaded, you can now populate the "clouds.yaml" file with appropriate values

Then, the python code to use SHADE to connect to the cloud and interrogate the capabilities will work!
NOTABLY the list of images will work and you can manipulate the resulting DICT objects to make a list of images in a file to refer to later.

NOTE: the listing of FLAVORS takes a LONG time, with lots of connection messages comning through.
So, to get the list, be patient!! and let it run.

CREATING AN INSTANCE - i.e. starting an actual server.
using the given example at the http://developer.openstack.org/firstapp-shade/ site, the instance creation reports a problem:
"Server reached ACTIVE state without being allocated an IP address"
There were several indicators in the output that the status of the system was "ACTIVE", however, there is no record of the server being instantiated on the citycloud servers.
A check on the running servers via the SHADE API, showed no instances or servers running.

THEREFORE, it is concluded that FIRST, a network must be configured in the region in which one is working so that when the instance is created via shade, there is a network infrastructure present to provide IP addresses and general connectivity.
Presently, this will be done via the citycloud web control pannel.

NETWORK:
A network called "bobnet" has been created via the citycloud web interface in the region KNA1 (Karlskrona):
bobnet	IPv4 10.1.0.0/24	External IP: 188.212.108.142

The server/instance creation is then retried:
SUCCESS!!!
See file "Instance_creation_output"
The instance is pingable too!!!
ping -c4 188.212.109.247

The citycloud server dashboard shows the new server as online and available!

The instantiating of the test instance was successful!

A quick script was used to delete the running instance, as such things COST REAL MONEY!!
The delete process is reasonably quick and the script returns no output upon success.

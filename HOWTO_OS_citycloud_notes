After you get registered to login to citycloud and can see the parts of the interface....

You should CREATE A USER
Even though you have a user (an admin) that can login to the site, this is NOT the user that OS will use for operations on the API!!

via API->Native Openstack API "Create user" button:
make a new user with a password, and drag accross the default project so that they can use it.
NOTE: "API user created successfully" message should be received when the user is added and given access to the project

NOW, with the user created, they appear in the "Native Openstack API" page under "Users"
AND, there is a "cog" wheel button to the right of the user, this button has the option to "Download RC-File", which is what is mentioned in the OpenStack and Shade documents

With that file downloaded, you can now populate the "clouds.yaml" file with appropriate values

Then, the python code to use SHADE to connect to the cloud and interrogate the capabilities will work!
NOTABLY the list of images will work and you can manipulate the resulting DICT objects to make a list of images in a file to refer to later.

NOTE: the listing of FLAVORS takes a LONG time, with lots of connection messages comning through.
So, to get the list, be patient!! and let it run.
